### Comp 306 Database Management Systems - Term Project

This is the term project of the course "Comp 306 - Database Management Systems" in spring 2018 semester. In this project, we designed an online shopping platform similar to n11.com. Our hypothetical platform has various products from many categories and customers can easily choose between products and purchase them with any of the available payment options. In order to buy any product, users should sign up to the website. Membership option can be either standard or premium like Amazon Prime.

The detailed project description can be found in the final report pdf.
